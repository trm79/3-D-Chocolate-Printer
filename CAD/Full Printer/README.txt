# Summary

Provided are STL files for the 101Hero.
I also link the source SLDPRT files

I will eventually modify some parts to improve it. I will dub it the "201SuperHero"
Thanks to Xander Carey for the name.

Designed in SOLIDWORKS 2017 and same program used to export as STL (default export settings, IDK what they are)

Measured using 6 inch Mitutoyo Vernier Caliper (not digital)
+/- 1/128 inch

I did my utmost in making the names descriptive. My design method heavily relied on symmetry. Some parts were initially assumed symmetrical but actually weren't which made design completion hold up a lot.

I sourced some files from users on GrabCAD. I add their usernames into the filenames.

I also sourced files from McMasterCarr

Some files were not exactly right from those sources, and I modify them.

One little adventure was the limit switch. Nobody seemed to have modeled the exact one on our printer. So I found the datasheet and modeled it.

I did my very best to be as accurate and detailed as possible.

In the process I actually cut myself with my sharp edged caliper. It was also hot on that day. And that cut kinda made me tear up a little.

I literally put my blood, sweat, and tears into this thing. :)
